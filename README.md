A Chrome Extension made by me.
Well what does it do? - you may ask.
it's function is to play constant ***shuddering*** sounds every time
your current tab trys to play a audio. Pretty cool innit?

install the .zip file below and upload it to your chrome browser(needs developer mode to be enabled);
i might upload it to the extension store,*sometime*.

As Usual i'd like to thank [poopy](https://github.com/poopyyyyy) for helping me test my code out.
Anyways Thank you for reading! Try it out and lmk!
I'm going to start on working on some bigger & complex projects soon aswell.
